My First Repo-Details
This is my personal portfolio.
I started learning programming from Nov 2020 in the pandamic. I was searching right tutorial for my learning. I have gone through many more useful , unuseful tutorial video's but I never got confidence about whatever I learnt from that video.
When I started following TanayPratap's channel on Youtube, I able to get little idea about where to start and what to learn. Thereafter I have gone through the some important video's about beginners learning video ang I got to know about "neog.camp".
And like wise started my level zero of neogcamp journey.
